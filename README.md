# Predicting Customer Churn Using RFM and CLV Metrics

## Introduction
Customer retention is a key focus for businesses aiming to maximize profitability and sustain long-term growth. It is widely known that retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. However, customer churn — when a customer stops doing business with a company — remains a persistent challenge.

In this project, we aim to predict whether a customer is likely to churn using important customer behavior indicators such as:

Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency – How often they make purchases.

Monetary – How much money they spend.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – An estimate of the total worth of a customer to a business over the duration of their relationship.

By training machine learning models on these features, we build a system that classifies customers into “churn” and “non-churn” categories. With this prediction, businesses can proactively target at-risk customers with retention strategies — such as personalized offers, loyalty programs, or engagement campaigns — thereby improving customer lifetime value and reducing revenue loss.

This work not only enables the prediction of churn, but also guides data-driven customer retention efforts, especially for high-value customers
